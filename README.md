### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Megha Pathak!

![Hello-gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/brsEO1JayBVja/giphy.gif)

I build things for the web.
I'm a product minded, full-stack developer who specializes in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I'm an engineer at [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) building the product that changes the way developers blog and help them share knowledge easily.

I often [write](https://meghapathak.com) about Product Management, Community building and Web Developemt.

- ðŸ’¬ I love discussing about Open Source, Front-end development, Product Management Communities, and Writing. If you want to discuss any of these topics you can even shoot me an email at midnight (and I will probably respond to it instantly).
